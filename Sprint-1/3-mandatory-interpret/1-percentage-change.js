// Read the code and then answer the questions below

// a) How many function calls are there in this file? Write down all the lines where a function call is made

// carprice.replaceAll(), Number(), priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll(), Number(), console.log()

// b) Run the code and identify the line where the error is coming from - why is this error occurring? How can you fix this problem?

//The error code was due a missing comma within priceAfterOneYear.replaceAll. 

// c) Identify all the lines that are variable reassignment statements

//carPrice on line 4 is a variable reassignment and so is priceAfterOneYear on line 5

// d) Identify all the lines that are variable declarations

//1, 2, 7, 8 

// e) Describe what the expression Number(carPrice.replaceAll(",","")) is doing - what is the purpose of this expression?

// This expression is finding all commas and replacing them as nothing. To put it simply, it is removing all commas
// The purpose is to make the string into a pure numerical value so it can be used in calculations.
